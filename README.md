# The Movie DB
This project was completed as part of a technical on boarding challenge for a company. It was built on the default 
vue-cli project creation tool and does not rely on any external styling or component libraries.

## Notes for assessors
This project was created using the standard vue-cli tool. My understanding is this is similar to create-react-app. It 
simply sets up the webpack and other configuration. Feel free to reach out to me if I've misintepreted any of the 
requirements or if anything needs clarification.
